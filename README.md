A simple tool to scan and remove unwanted directories from your system.

It may takes between 10 or 15 seconds if you pass a path 200Gb and 2 million files. It's really fast if you narrow the search.

It was used as a demo on our internal Golang program. It contains different versions with improvements.

Path: [/]: Scanned 2,045,830 files. Matched 254,183 in 2,731 directories. [1.9 GB]
